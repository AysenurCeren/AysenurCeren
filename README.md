I am proficient in designing, modeling, testing, and integrating 2D games using Unity with C#. My expertise extends to developing applications in C#, where I leverage the language to create diverse forms and integrate with Microsoft SQL Server (MsSQL).

Additionally, I possess substantial experience in web development, having created a range of websites from simple to complex, and from vibrant to minimalist. I utilize a variety of technologies including PHP, AJAX, HTML, CSS, SEO, and MySQL to build these sites according to user requirements and my own conceptual designs.

Moreover, I am skilled in programming languages such as C and Java. I am adept at project reporting, employing feasibility studies and process management reporting to effectively document and manage each project I undertake.
